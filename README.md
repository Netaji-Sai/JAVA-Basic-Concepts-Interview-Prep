# Java OOP Pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
Welcome to the repository! ðŸš€ This collection of Java code examples is designed to help you master the 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which are key to acing your Software Developer interviews.

# ðŸ“š What's Included:
## 1. Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the concept of restricting access to certain details of an object's data. Through getters and setters, you can control how the data is accessed or modified, promoting data hiding.

### Example:

Student class with private fields for name, rollNo, and grade. Getters and setters ensure that grades are only set within valid ranges.


## 2. Inheritance:
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another, promoting code reuse. In this example, the Car class extends the Vehicle class, inheriting its properties and methods.

### Example:

A base Vehicle class with properties brand and speed is extended by a Car class, which adds a doors property.


## 3. Polymorphism:
Polymorphism allows you to use a single method name for different behaviors. It can be compile-time (method overloading) or runtime (method overriding).

### Example:

A Calculator class with multiple add methods (overloading) and an Animal class with overridden makeSound() methods in Dog and Cat classes.


## 4. Abstraction:
Abstraction allows you to define general behavior in an abstract class, leaving specific implementation details to be defined in subclasses. This promotes code flexibility and a clean, extendable design.

### Example:

An abstract Shape class with area() and perimeter() methods, implemented by concrete classes Circle and Rectangle.
